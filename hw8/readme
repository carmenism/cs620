Assignment 8

No special information is needed to run this program.  After calling "make",
simply call .\barber.  The program requires three integer values to be entered
to represent the duration time (in minutes), the mean inter-arrival time (in
seconds), and the mean service time (in seconds).  The program will finish
executing after the duration time has passed but it can also easily be killed
with ctrl+C if necessary.
